# South Korea Population Dynamics Analysis 📊🇰🇷

## Welcome to the South Korea Population Dynamics Analysis repository! 
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the population dynamics in South Korea from 2004 to 2023 using the logistic population model. By estimating key parameters such as the growth rate and carrying capacity, we aim to predict South Korea's population for the years 2030, 2040, and 2050.

# Key Features
. Historical Data Analysis 📈: Examines population trends over the past 20 years.

. Logistic Population Model 🧮: Utilizes the logistic model to understand and predict population growth.

. Future Predictions 🔮: Provides population estimates for 2030, 2040, and 2050.

. Factors Influencing Population 🌍: Discusses the impact of birth rates, healthcare, economic development, and migration on population changes.

# Data Sources
Population data for this analysis were obtained from the World Bank open data.

# Model Used
The logistic population model formula used is:

P(t) = (P_0 + (M - P_0)e^(-kt)) / (1 + (M/P_0 - 1)e^(-kt))



From the growth rate formula:

dp/dt = KP(M - P)


we estimated the key parameters:

K = growth rate constant

M = carrying capacity

# Results

. The logistic model predicts that South Korea's population will stabilize around its carrying capacity in the coming decades, with minimal fluctuations from 2030 onwards.
